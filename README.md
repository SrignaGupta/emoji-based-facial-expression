# emoji-based-facial-expression
This system uses a camera to detect your facial emotions—like happy, sad, or angry—and instantly displays a matching emoji on the
screen. It creates a fun and interactive way to visualize how you're feeling in real time.
Displaying Emoji Based Facial Expressions
In this project we are detecting facial expression from images and then based on expression we are displaying emoji’s to user. To implement this project we have designed following modules
1)	Upload Image With Face: using this module we will upload images
2)	Preprocess & Detect Face in Image: using this module we will preprocess image and then look for presence of human face and if face detected then only it will predict facial expression
3)	Detect Facial Expression: upon detecting face this module will predict facial expression and based on expression emoji will be displayed
